   - Note: This command requires Administrator permissions.
- **Link Steam:** To participate in lobbies, link your Steam account with the command `/link-steam`. This will grant you the Linked role, indicating youâ€™re ready to join lobbies.
   - Note: You need to link your account only once, but you can reuse this command to change you linked steam.

- **Match Setup:** Once the lobby is full, the bot will automatically handle the game setup and notify all players as well as create teams channels, ensuring each player is moved to their respective channel.
